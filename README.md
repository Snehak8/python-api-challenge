# python-api-challenge


**Description**
The Python API Challenge is a project that includes two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy. In WeatherPy, we visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator using the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and Matplotlib. The project involves creating scatter plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude, and computing linear regression for each relationship. In VacationPy, we use the weather data skills obtained in Part 1 to plan future vacations. We utilize Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API to create map visualizations displaying points for every city in the city data DataFrame.

**Installation**
To run the Python API Challenge, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You also need to install the required libraries such as pandas, requests, matplotlib, and geopandas. You can install these libraries using pip:

**Usage**
**WeatherPy:**
Open the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file.
Run the notebook cells to generate random geographic coordinates, retrieve weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API, create scatter plots showcasing relationships between weather variables and latitude, and compute linear regression for each relationship.
VacationPy:
Open the VacationPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
Run the notebook cells to import the required libraries, load the CSV file with weather and coordinates data, use the Geoapify API and the geopandas library to create map visualizations, and plan future vacations based on weather conditions.
